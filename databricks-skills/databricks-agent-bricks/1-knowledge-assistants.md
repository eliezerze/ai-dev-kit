# Knowledge Assistants (KA)

Knowledge Assistants are document-based Q&A systems that use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer questions from indexed documents.

## What is a Knowledge Assistant?

A KA connects to documents stored in a Unity Catalog Volume and allows users to ask natural language questions. The system:

1. **Indexes** all documents in the volume (PDFs, text files, etc.)
2. **Retrieves** relevant chunks when a question is asked
3. **Generates** an answer using the retrieved context

## When to Use

Use a Knowledge Assistant when:
- You have a collection of documents (policies, manuals, guides, reports)
- Users need to find specific information without reading entire documents
- You want to provide a conversational interface to documentation

## Prerequisites

Before creating a KA, you need documents in a Unity Catalog Volume:

**Option 1: Use existing documents**
- Upload PDFs/text files to a Volume manually or via SDK

**Option 2: Generate synthetic documents**
- Use the `databricks-unstructured-pdf-generation` skill to create realistic PDF documents
- Each PDF gets a companion JSON file with question/guideline pairs for evaluation

## Creating a Knowledge Assistant

Use the CLI to create a Knowledge Assistant:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the Knowledge Assistant
databricks knowledge-assistants create-knowledge-assistant \
  "HR Policy Assistant" \
  "Answers questions about HR policies and procedures"

# Step 2: Add a knowledge source (volume with documents)
databricks knowledge-assistants create-knowledge-source \
  "knowledge-assistants/{ka_id}" \
  "HR Documents" \
  "HR policy documents" \
  "VOLUME" \
  --volume-config '{"volume_id": "/Volumes/my_catalog/my_schema/raw_data/hr_docs"}'

# Step 3: Sync (index) the knowledge sources
databricks knowledge-assistants sync-knowledge-sources "knowledge-assistants/{ka_id}"
```

The CLI will:
1. Create the KA with the specified configuration
2. Create a knowledge source pointing to your volume
3. Trigger indexing of the documents

## Provisioning Timeline

After creation, the KA endpoint needs to provision:

| Status | Meaning | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `PROVISIONING` | Creating the endpoint | 2-5 minutes |
| `ONLINE` | Ready to use | - |
| `OFFLINE` | Not currently running | - |

Use the CLI to check the status:

```bash
databricks knowledge-assistants get-knowledge-assistant "knowledge-assistants/{ka_id}"
```

## Adding Example Questions

Example questions help with:
- **Evaluation**: Test if the KA answers correctly
- **User onboarding**: Show users what to ask

### Automatic (from PDF generation)

If you used `generate_pdf_documents`, each PDF has a companion JSON with:
```json
{
  "question": "What is the company's remote work policy?",
  "guideline": "Should mention the 3-day minimum in-office requirement"
}
```

These are automatically added when `add_examples_from_volume=true` (default).

### Manual

Examples can also be added manually via the Databricks UI or SDK.

## Best Practices

### Document Organization

- **One volume per topic**: e.g., `/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw_data/hr_docs`, `/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw_data/tech_docs`
- **Clear naming**: Name files descriptively so chunks are identifiable

### Instructions

Good instructions improve answer quality:

```
Be helpful and professional. When answering:
1. Always cite the specific document and section
2. If multiple documents are relevant, mention all of them
3. If the information isn't in the documents, clearly say so
4. Use bullet points for multi-part answers
```

### Updating Content

To update the indexed documents:
1. Add/remove/modify files in the volume
2. Trigger a sync to re-index:
   ```bash
   databricks knowledge-assistants sync-knowledge-sources "knowledge-assistants/{ka_id}"
   ```
3. The KA will re-index the updated content

## Example Workflow

1. **Generate PDF documents** using `databricks-unstructured-pdf-generation` skill:
   - Creates PDFs in `/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw_data/pdf_documents`
   - Creates JSON files with question/guideline pairs

2. **Create the Knowledge Assistant**:
   - `name`: "My Document Assistant"
   - `volume_path`: "/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw_data/pdf_documents"

3. **Wait for ONLINE status** (2-5 minutes)

4. **Examples are automatically added** from the JSON files

5. **Test the KA** in the Databricks UI

## Using KA in Supervisor Agents

Knowledge Assistants can be used as agents in a Supervisor Agent (formerly Multi-Agent Supervisor, MAS). Each KA has an associated model serving endpoint.

### Finding the Endpoint Name

Use the CLI to retrieve the KA details:

```bash
# List all KAs to find the one you want
databricks knowledge-assistants list-knowledge-assistants

# Get details for a specific KA
databricks knowledge-assistants get-knowledge-assistant "knowledge-assistants/{ka_id}"
```

The response includes:
- `name`: The resource name (knowledge-assistants/{ka_id})
- `display_name`: The KA display name
- Status information

The endpoint name follows this pattern: `ka-{tile_id}-endpoint`

### Example: Adding KA to Supervisor Agent

```bash
# First, list KAs to find the tile_id
databricks knowledge-assistants list-knowledge-assistants

# Then use the tile_id to create a Supervisor Agent with manager.py
python manager.py create_mas "Support_MAS" '{
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "hr_agent",
            "ka_tile_id": "<tile_id from list>",
            "description": "Answers HR policy questions from the employee handbook"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Endpoint stays in PROVISIONING

- Check workspace capacity and quotas
- Verify the volume path is accessible
- Wait up to 10 minutes before investigating further

### Documents not indexed

- Ensure files are in a supported format (PDF, TXT, MD)
- Check file permissions in the volume
- Verify the volume path is correct

### Poor answer quality

- Add more specific instructions
- Ensure documents are well-structured
- Consider breaking large documents into smaller files
